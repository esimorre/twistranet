Design considerations for TwistraNet


Database consistancy
====================

The model is not a rdbm-normal one, THIS IS ON PURPOSE:
1/ for read performance reasons
2/ to allow the model to be quite easily migrated to a nosql backend someday

The framework normally takes care of keeping it straight. But it may be broken in some way (fixture not correct, updates or bugs, crashes, ...)
Here are some clues to ensure that the schema is ok:

1/ Content types

Content are typed, but the 'content' table holds generic information. Check every content type object and check that content.content_type field is set to the right type.
