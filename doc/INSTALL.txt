Installation
------------

Open a command line

Twistranet and all dependencies are downloaded and installed
in your python path ::

  - piston
  
  - ...

launch at command prompt 

  >> twistranet startproject mysite

This will install all twistranet django stuff in 'mysite' folder.

Create Twistranet Database
Reply "no" to the question about superuser creation  
(because the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE has changed, it doesn't work)  
The data is stored in data/tn.db when using sqlite
    
    >> cd mysite
    >> python manage.py syncdb

Bootstrap the first data
The structure by default is set in twistranet/fixtures/initial_data.json
You can define in this file a new superuser (by default admin/azerty1234)
    
    >> python manage.py twistranet_bootstrap

Run the server in foreground

    (twistranet) >> python manage.py runserver
