Twistranet - Installation
=========================

Requirements
------------

- A computer with your favorite os, example :

    - linux (debian, redhat, ubuntu, etc ...)

    - windows (xp, seven, vista, 2003 server etc)

    - Mac OS X ...

- an internet connection

- python2.6 or later (python 3 is not supported)
- twistranet can also work with python2.5 (but install simplejson)

    To install python, goto http://python.org/download/
    choose, download, and install the last Python 2.xx for your platform.
    Under Linux or Mac OS, Python is often pre-installed

- PIL http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

- PIP

PIP is the new installer for python packages, it replaces
setuptools with many powerful features (install, list intalled, uninstall, upgrade ...)

If setuptools is installed on your system (setuptools, also called easy_install is the old python packages installer), 
you can just enter at command prompt::

    $ easy_install pip

If setuptools is not here, you can install PIP from sources, 

under linux ::

    $ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-0.8.1.tar.gz 
    $ tar xzf pip-0.8.1.tar.gz

.. note:: Under macos you can use curl -O <url> instead of wget

.. note:: Under windows just download and unpack the folder 'pip-0.8.1'

Open a command prompt::

    $ cd pip-0.8.1
    $ python setup.py install
    $ cd ..
    $ rm -Rf pip-0.8.1


.. seealso:: More information can be found here : http://guide.python-distribute.org/installation.html

- if you want to install the devel version of Twistranet, install also GIT (more information here https://github.com/)

Installation
------------

Open a command line
To install the last Twistranet released version (not released at this time)

    $ pip install django-twistranet        

.. note:: behind an http proxy you need to add an option to pip, exemple:: pip --proxy proxy-server:proxy-port install django-twistranet 

Or to install the devel version from github Twistranet public repository, open a command line

    $ git clone git://github.com/numericube/twistranet.git ./django-twistranet
    $ pip install ./django-twistranet 

.. note:: the './' is important here, it can be replaced by any "path to" expression

Delete the installation folder, no more used

    $ rm -Rf ./Twistranet

Twistranet and all its dependencies are downloaded and installed
in your python path ::

  - Twistranet
  
  - Django

This will install all you need for your project in 'mysite' folder :

  - your project configuration 'local_settings.py'
  
  - django initialization files

If you need to customize css and templates
You can initialize the customization work by copy/paste standard Twistranet templates
and themes in 'mysite' folder, just change the previous command
with::

    $ twistranet_project -t mysite

You will probably have to change some configuration in local_settings.py

    $ cd mysite
    $ python manage.py syncdb

    $ python manage.py twistranet_bootstrap

Run the server in foreground

    $ python manage.py runserver
